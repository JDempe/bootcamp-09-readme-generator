# CBC Week 09 Challenge: README Generator
## Description

This project is the seventh from the UC Berkeley Coding Boot Camp.  The goal is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username and other information pertaining to the project the README is for.  The application will then generate a README.md file based on the user's input.  The README will include the following sections:

- Title
- Table of Contents
- Description
- Installation Instructions
- Usage Information
- Test Instructions
- Contribution Guidelines
- License
- Questions

There will also be a badge for the license that is chosen and a link to the license.
